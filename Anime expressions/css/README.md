# Fonts for the web
Web designers carefully consider the font styles for their website.

The <strong>three</strong> most common categories of font are:

- Library fonts
- Web safe fonts
- Fallback fonts
<br>
<p><strong><i>Library fonts</i></strong> are typically imported from a third-party library such as <u>Google Fonts</u>. Companies sometimes pay a fee to use a font as part of their website branding.</p>

<p><strong><i>Web safe fonts</i></strong> are standard fonts that should be available through any web browser. However, you can never be 100% sure that this is the case. Here is a list of web safe fonts:</p>

- Arial
- Verdana
- Helvetica
- Tahoma
- Trebuchet MS
- Times New Roman
- Georgia
- Garamond
- Courier New
- Brush Script MT

<p><strong><i>Fallback fonts</i></strong> are generic font families that are used to match the styling that the web designer would like to use. The main font families are:</p>

- <strong><i>Serif:</i></strong> a font style typically used in print publishing, letters have tiny decorative edges called ‘serifs’
- <strong><i>Sans-serif:</i></strong> a clean screen-readable font without the decorative edges
- <strong><i>Monospace:</i></strong> a font where each character uses the same width of space
- <strong><i>Cursive:</i></strong> a handwriting font
- <strong><i>Fantasy:</i></strong> a decorative font typically used for big headings
<p>If a fallback font isn’t listed, then the web browser uses the browser’s default font, which is typically Times New Roman.</p>
